Description: spThin is a set of functions that can be used to spatially thin
    species occurrence data. The resulting thinned data can be used in ecological
    modeling, such as ecological niche modeling.
    The core thinning algorithm was replace by a new version written by Robert Bjornson
    and Steve Weston.  The original algorithm is available by doing:
    thin(...,algorith=thin.algorithm.orig,...)
