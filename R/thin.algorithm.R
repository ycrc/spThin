#' @title Implements random spatial thinning algorithm
#' 
#' @description \code{thin.algorithm} implements a randomization approach to
#' spatially thinning species occurence data. This function is the algorithm underlying
#' the \code{\link{thin}} function.
#' 
#' @param rec.df.orig A data frame of long/lat points for each presence record. The 
#' data.frame should be a two-column data frame, one column of long and one of 
#' lat
#' @param thin.par Thinning parameter - the distance (in kilometers) that you want
#' records to be separated by.
#' @param reps The number of times to repete the thinning process. Given the random
#' process of removing nearest-neighbors there should be 'rep' number of different
#' sets of coordinates.
#' @return reduced.rec.dfs: A list object of length 'rep'. Each list element is a different
#' data.frame of spatially thinned presence records.

## ******************************************************************** ##
## Below is legacy code that is temporarly being stored in this file.
## After a round of peer-review, we recieved a suggestion that in how
## the algorithm works that fundamentally changed the alogirthm and
## increased its efficiency by orders of magnitude.
## The code below remains so that MA-L can incorporate comments
## appropriately to the new code.

#   ## General Algorithm:
#   ## ******************
#   ## While at least one member of the nearest neighbor vector is less than 10 km
#   ## remove one of the points associated with nearest neighbor less than 10km randomly
#   ##
#   ## A few more details:
#   ## 1. Define thinning parameter
#   ## 2. Find all points with nearest neighbor closer than thinning parameter
#   ## 3. Randomly delete one of these points
#   ## 4. Continue until no points have nearest neighbor closer than thinning parameter
#   ## 5. Repeat many times 
#   ##
